# E-and-Ict-Academy-iit kanpur
It is a reposity of html,css and other web tools(php,java script and others). I went to IIT Kanpur in 2nd semester(1st year) E and Ict section. Their I met Dipil sir. I still am in contact wit him. He taught me about the web development in detail in just a short span of 15 dats(3 Jan 2020 to 17 jan 2020). The repository is collection of codes and practices which I did in these 15 days.
